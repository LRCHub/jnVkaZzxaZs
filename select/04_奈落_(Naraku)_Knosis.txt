You wanna stop me?
You're gonna have to fucking kill me

Oh, look into my eyes and tell me off
Oh, look at me and tell me that I'm different
Oh, look into my life and bring me down
You seem so inconsistent and there for nonexistent
This mortal coil, eternal doom
I'm trapped inside my frozen soul
Eternal doom, this chaos is what I was made for
Where I am made whole

Peel my flesh to wear my skin
Drink the curse from blood within
Peel my flesh to wear my skin
Drink the curse from blood within

Well, are you ready yet?
Well, are you ready?

Did you wanna die yet?
I saved a bullet for myself, but you seem to need it more and more than I did
I won't tell them what you've done, bury deep inside your corpse, you wanna die yet?
I saved a bullet for myself, but you seem to need it more and more than I did
I won't tell them what you've done, bury deep inside your corpse, you wanna?

Dreaming with your morals aside
Lean in to the mortal life

No need to be so convicting when you're living a lie
Play, imitate everything that I am, but you're not convincing
Feel a bit claustrophobic, there's more of me
But I see 'em talking that shit as they're riding my dick, I can see right through it
Right through it

Overrated understatement
Hide behind the complications

Did you wanna die yet?
I saved a bullet for myself, but you seem to need it more and more than I did
I won't tell them what you've done, bury deep inside your corpse, you wanna die yet?
I saved a bullet for myself, but you seem to need it more and more than I did
I won't tell them what you've done, bury deep inside your corpse, you wanna?

Flash back to the corner of your misery
Mind raped in my eyes, I had no hope to bleed
Blacked out everything, I was in history
What I was is dead to me, dead to me
What I was is dead to me
Black out every history
Everything is dead to me

Did you wanna die yet?
I saved a bullet for myself, but you seem to need it more and more than I did
I won't tell them what you've done, bury deep inside your corpse
Did you wanna die yet?
I saved a bullet for myself, but you seem to need it more and more than I did
I won't tell them what you've done, bury deep inside your corpse, you wanna die yet?
I saved a bullet for myself, but you seem to need it more and more than I did
I won't tell them what you've done, bury deep inside your corpse, you wanna die yet?
I saved a bullet for myself, but you seem to need it more and more than I did
I won't tell them what you've done, bury deep inside your corpse, you wanna?
