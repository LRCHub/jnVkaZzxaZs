Come on, forget everything that lingers in your mind
Our hands are covered in blood no matter how we try
Wake up, let go of your fears, as wind blows and shows the way
Don't be afraid - it's a sign

1

Run away from here, run away from here
Don't get caught by the night full of misery
Here in this place where the crying echoes still dwell
You're not the flower of Hell

Don't bloom in this place, don't bloom in this place
They will tear you apart, your petals one by one
The shards of time will pass us by without making a sound

Tell me who it is that just gripped onto my hand?
Who's that staring back from the dark, running fingers through my hair?
Just now I cried my eyes out, but I think I found the way
No longer afraid - it's a sign

2

Jump into the night, run before you bleed
From relentless gears of our destiny
Here in this place where the crying echoes still dwell
You're not the flower of Hell
Don't leave petals here and don't sow your seeds
They'll deteriorate and slowly rot away

But if one day they sprout, then karma will come around again

3

Run away from here, run away from here
Don't get caught by the night full of misery
Here in this place where the crying echoes still dwell
You're not the flower of Hell

Don't bloom in this place, don't bloom in this place
They will tear you apart, your petals one by one
The shards of time will pass us by without making a sound
